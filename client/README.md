Welcome to my weather app!

This app uses React to create an interface where users can connect with two APIs that work in sequence (to find coordinate data based on city/state inputs, and to search weather data based on latitude/longitude) to provide a pleasing weather display with pertinent information such as temperatures, humidity, wind, etc.

This app uses Express, Mongoose and MongoDB to provide a database for storing user credentials and their saved weather locations.
